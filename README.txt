started on 10th October 2022
created new project with MvcMovie followed the steps in the tutorial before starting my project
After building little confidence
Decided to start with class Assignment
Doubt arose regarding the naming of project whether to name as Pillows or Pillow or MvcPillow
2022/10/11 Trial on using different names
Failed in the first attempt
Againg 2022/10/11 Tried and could succedd to certain extent
Finally started working on my project PillowCompany, succeeded till part 3 of the tutorial
2022/10/12 Created a project with new name PillowFactory succeeded scaffolding and when I tried installing migration problems started
Migration and Update succeded but asking me to choose DbContext which was once again a problem
Again 2022/10/13 continued with the same project choosing DbContext which I thought was correct
Able to move on without errors but with fear about errors in future and way resolve them
I could not run my program because some error 
Since the submission has been extended, i decided to restart the project once again and a new name for my project is PillowComp
2022/10/14 project named PillowComp and started working
I could finish scaffolding, migration
I forgot mention before, Whenever I created a new project, I created newRepository.Exhausted. I am stopping for today
2022/10/15 started with same project and continued with seeding Data
so far so good, things ar emoving smoothly I am also building little hope that I can move forward with project.
I also wrote some introduction to my company. Don't know if i have palced in the correctt page.
finished part-5, Creating Seed.cs and aslo adding the seed initializer
Everything seems okay, I am excited because i can see my Pillows table with values
Took half an hour break
2022/10/15 at 6PM, working on the project.
Part-6 started
opened Models/Pillow.csand required changes are made on Pillow.cs in the place Manufacture Date.
Edit,Details,Delete links are checked to match with the tutorials.
Required changes are made in Edit.cshtml
Movie file created by the system is compared with the tutorials
After running a program and navigation to Pilloes URL and clicking on Edit link, the generated HTML for the <form> is shown and I compared it with the tutorial file
Required changes made under [HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
Views/Movies/Edit.cshtml did not work for me. I moved on to Part-7
PillowsController.cs changes made and followed the remaing steps carefully not to make a mess
Seems okay
As I was going through I missed out something in the Tutorial which is to create a class in models folder
According to tutorial this contains Genre which I do not have in my properties
Any way I added a new class to models folder aPillowNameViewModel.cs
I have no idea about this file with my project
I tried creating a link for about us, Views/Home right clicked and added a newitem About.cshtml, but the link is not shown on the mainpage.
I used private policy to include history of the company
I want to insert pillow images but I don't remeber exactly how this is done
I have been trying on this but each time I am failing.
As muc as I can I finished, 
I spent lot of time on this project.
Hope it turns out successful
